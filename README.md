# Vivid Alpha

This is a preview of code generated by Vivid's alpha from your Figma design!

## Vivid Teams

Vivid Teams lets you manage your design system from Figma by generating modular, usable frontend components for your developers.

Vivid Teams syncs with your GitHub repository to match components in Figma to components already implemented in your codebase and automatically generate pull requests for developers to review when designs are submitted.

Vivid Teams is now live! If you want to try it out, get set up at [app.vivid.lol](https://app.vivid.lol).

If you want to chat with us, feel free to reach out to us for a [demo](https://calendly.com/aryamankha/vivid-demo).

## Details

Vivid currently generates React code using TypeScript and either CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS. Components created by Vivid are stored within the "components" folder.

To edit what is rendered in the sandbox, you can modify pages/index.tsx.

Vivid is still in alpha! We are working nonstop to improve the quality of our code generation and ship features to make your experience incredible.
